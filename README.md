## Motivation:
Growing up with a quadriplegic mother and understanding the everyday challenges her injury created, it was very inspiring for me to see her accomplishments post injury, especially when I understood how much more difficult everyday life was for her compared to an able-bodied person. 
During my mother's initial hospitalization post injury, her doctor told her that she would never drive, never get married and never have a family. Not only did she accomplish all three of these milestones, but she also went on to obtain a Bachelor's degree from an elite university as well as work to help other SCI survivors achieve independent living.
Due to my experience, I would like to better understand how other survivors' life milestones compare at injury versus post injury. Do they let their injury stop them from continuing to live a full life? Or do they continue to strive for their goals, even with the everyday obstacles their SCI injury places in front of them?
## Questions:
How does a SCI injury survivor's milestones compare at injury vs post injury? Do they let their injury stop them from continuing to live a full life? Or do they continue to strive for their goals, even with the everyday obstacles their SCI injury places in front of them?
- What is the average age a spinal cord injury occurs?
- What is the average number of years a SCI survivor lives post-injury vs at large?
- What percentage of survivors continue to give birth at injury vs post injury?
- What percentage of survivors continue to pursue higher education at injury vs post injury?
- What percentage of survivors continue to pursue a career at injury vs post injury?

## Normalizing the Data
The dataset I selected consisted of years from 1972 through 2021. 
I selected to work with all data over a thirty year period.

The database analyzed contained three datasets: Form I which contained at injury information, Form II which contained post injury information ranging from 1 year up to 30+ years after injury, and Record Status, which contains records of survivor's who have passed away, their date of death and cause of death.

I then created multiple dataframes per data question and narrowed down to the values that I wanted to use for my analysis. 

## Problems and Hurdles
It took a considerable amount of time to review and clean all three datasets. Figuring out how to extract, organize and aggregate the information over a 30-year period took a lot of considerable thought and trial and error.

## Technologies Used
1) Python: Matplotlib / NumPy / Pandas / Seaborn - for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of the dataset
2) Power Bi - for project presentation
## Data Sources
To answer the above questions I used the following sources to collect datasets for my analysis:
1) National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center
https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/Research/NSCISC_DatabasePublicUse
2) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "Life Expectancy Dropped for the Second Year in a Row in 2021"
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220831.htm
## Conclusion

The average age of spinal cord injury is 35.93 years, a formidable time in a person's life.

As of 2021, the average life expectancy of a SCI survivor was 64.30 years, compared to the overall US life expectancy of 76.33.

Survivors do not let their injury stop them from continuing to pursue higher education. Post injury, post high school degrees obtained increased by 50.45%.

Maintaining a working career as a SCI survivor could be difficult but is still possible. 

Survivors are still getting married, but divorces grew at over three times the marriage rate.

Survivors continue to have children, with child births increasing 9.6% after injury.

It can be concluded from this data analysis that compared to at injury versus before injury, SCI survivors do not allow their injury to stop them from living their lives to the fullest.

Survivors still go on to pursue higher education, strive to maintain careers, get married and have children. 

It is very inspiring to see that my mother's journey was not an exception but the norm. I hope this data can give hope to other survivors that life does not stop at injury.
